I fix a problem about comment system in my github blog page. I always see a red words:<font color="red">Error:not found</font>.  

Finally I search this issue on the website, and address it afterwards.  

The reason is the repo name in _config.yml is incorrect. You should type the correct repo name, it is warden22.github.io rather than blog-comments.
